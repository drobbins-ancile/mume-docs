Leaping backwards, Gwathion regains his footing while putting some distance between himself and the great bear.
Gwathion quickly checks behind him for any additional foes, crouches down, then nocks another arrow.
With ludicrous speed and a deafening roar, the black bear darts forward!
It crashes its heavy body at Gwathion, sending him sprawling.
The bear ravages the defenseless Gwathion. It sinks its massive jaws into his neck and drags him deeper into the forest.
In a den, two famished bear cubs tear and rip at the corpse of Gwathion, eager to get at the meat. Those items of his that are not torn
and ripped to shreds end up scattered about the den; they are of no interest to the bears.

Room: A Bear's Den  
ID: 108226  
Location: Southwestern Mirkwood  
Description:  
The dark earth tunnel opens up into a natural, underground stone cave. Bones
bearing teeth marks, and even whole skeletons, lie higgledy-piggedly in a huge
pile just below a narrow hole in one wall of the cave. The hole gives onto
another, smaller cave which floor is higher than that of the main cave, so that
it forms a sort of raised platform which has been covered with brittle twigs
and leaves. The hard stone floor is stained with large patches of dried-up
blood, combined with traces of tails, legs and decaying skulls.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The two orcs enter a cave and with great effort, they lift the body of Gwathion towards the rear wall, attaching limbs to shackles.
A short yet long-haired orc cackles as she watches their newfound prisoner be secured.
As the orcs release the body, the shackles dig deep into the limp body of the elf, who slowly begins to regain consciousness.
The diminutive leader, a broad-shouldered orc grins at the elf, her hands gripping her warhammer firmly and introduces herself as Lazrria
of the Morgundul..
With a swift swing of the hammer, Lazrria slams the hammer against one of Gwathion's shackled hands, causing the elf to scream in pain,
His head lolls back as blood pours from the mangled mess that was his hand.
Only moments seem to pass and Gwathion rouses again. Lazrria smacks his face and questions him thoroughly about his presence, carving
into his chest with her dagger for every answer that displeases her.
The passing of time becomes irrelevant as Gwathion's consciousness fades slowly into nothingness. Lazrria snarls angrily, robbed of her
victim.
The shackles are removed and the corpse dragged away. Gwathion's belongings lie scattered in a dark corner of the cave, for the time
forgotten.

Room: The Orkish Commander's Hideout  
ID: 101296  
Location: Southeastern Lorien  
Description:  
The smell of rotting meat and blood becomes more intensive further down in the
hole. A cave with numerous holes and cavities in the walls has been dug here
by removing the scarce supply of soil and dirt, uncovering a natural cave with
walls of rock. Bones and rotting corpses have been hung in one of the holes in
the rear wall, while the others are filled with straw. Next to the biggest
hole, a table and a kind of throne have been built from heavy branches and
long bones.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Alas, it is to no avail. The keen snouts of the wargs catch scent of something, perhaps his bloody bandages, and howling and growling,
lead the patrol straight to the tree in which he's hiding.
He's dragged from his tree, and brought through the underground passage, to a hidden orc lair. There he is brought before a small and
hideous shaman.
He is questioned thoroughly but has no useful information to give him, which only encourages his captors to further brutalize him.
Beaten almost to death, he's thrown into the kennels as food for wargs. As a final gesture of defiance, Gwathion hides most of his
equipment among the straw and filth on the kennel's floor.

Room: Warg Kennels  
ID: 105773  
Location: West Anduin (NE of Lorien)  
Description:  
Many crudely built iron cages with tied gates line the far wall of this tiny,
filthy cavern. Tufts of fur and piles of droppings litter the floor, giving
very little clean walking space and adding to the musty odour of animals that
emanates from here.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The trolls quickly catch scent of Gwathion and the largest, a huge stone troll, stomps towards him.
Gwathion, realising the dreadful danger he's in, turns to flee from the trolls.
As Gwathion turns, he comes face to face with a grey mountain troll that grins at him and rumbles, 'Hello dinner!'
With a surprising show of reflexes and skill, Gwathion draws his blade and strikes at the troll. The troll will have none of it, and
sweeps the blade aside and lifts Gwathion in one huge fist, then slams him into the ground, crushing the life from him.
Fighting ensues over the delicious elf flesh. The mountain troll ferociously defends his meal against several smaller trolls, but the
huge stone troll manages to rip a leg off the corpse and promptly sits down on the spot to start gnawing on it.
Snarling, the troll stomps off through the undergrowth with its prize.
The mountain troll drags the one-legged corpse through a dark tunnel, past a troll den and into a small cavern. There it puts a large
stone slab over the opening and sits down to feast.
Feast over, the troll sits with its back towards the slab, dozing off and satisfied. Scattered about the cave lies the remains of
Gwathion and his equipment; the troll has no interest in the material possessions of an elf.

Room: Collapse Tunnel  
ID: 101934  
Location Between Vale and DG  
Description:  
The most prominent feature of this narrow alcove is the stench of rotting meat
that permeates everything in here. Spoils of war and strife are littered about
on the cave floor, mostly bones and skulls that have been crushed by merciless
hands not very long ago. The only exit from this unwholesome, dark hole lies to
the west, where a big opening leads into a big, nasty-smelling cave room.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Something moves in a muddy pool behind Gwathion.
A great lizard emerges from the mud, unheard and unseen.
When the lizard strikes, it is fast as lightning.
The lizard's powerful maw snaps closed around one of Gwathion's legs.
Blood gushes forth, drenching the ground.
The lizard drags the weakly struggling elf to his doom in a muddy hole on this nondescript riverbank.
As the elf disappears from view you can't help but wonder, is his body and belongings still down in that hole, waiting to be
discovered?

Room: Toppled Passageway  
ID: 21938  
Location: east anduin just N of ferry  
Description:  
This passageway is narrow but tall, assembled from grey stone blocks which at
one time were fit together masterfully, yet which have now crumbled within the
unyielding hands of time. The tunnel bends away to the east, but in the west it
has completely caved in. Many splintered bones lie scattered across the black,
damp dirt floor, and it appears that a large animal has excavated a sleeping
burrow into the western wall.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In anger, the troll roars and charges wildly. Fazed by the roar, Gwathion
fumbles and fails to dodge a blow that sends him crashing into the trunk of a
tree.
The troll licks his mouth and smiles, dragging the elf towards a hollow.
Gwathion awakens, bound and trapped in a damp and dark room.
Abruptly, the door opens. The large dark-green troll enters.
Unable to fend off his foe and trapped in the small room, Gwathion succumbs.
As the troll feasts on raw flesh, equipment and cloth ends up in a pile of
bones.
The troll burps loudly, tossing another bone onto the growing pile.
Several smaller trolls join the feast, gnawing on bones to get at the marrow.
Gwathion's equipment lies forgotten, buried under ripped cloth, bones, blood,
and filth.

Room: Bone-littered Prison Cell  
ID: 108617  
Location: Emyn (Rahku area)  
Description:  
The prison cell is a damp and dark room. It has been dug into the dark rock,
offering no exit out save to west where is a sturdy-looking stone door. There
are rusty shackles on the walls, some of them still containing remains of
unlucky prisoners. The floor is littered with bones, some of them apparently
gnawed with large, strong jaws.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Gwathion, weakening slowly, suffers under a large whip, wielded by the leader.
He cackles 'Amal shufar, at rugg', and then in guttural Westron, 'Where there
is a whip, there is a way.'
On the third day, Gwathion's spirit finally gives out. His broken body is
tossed to the wargs, whom devour it fully.
Gwathion's equipment, after an initial thorough search, lies seemingly
forgotten under some pieces of rotten canvas.

Room: Rough Camp by the Anduin  
ID: 101861  
Location: east anduin  
Description:  
Here, amidst the normally peaceful, riverside forest, an untidy, semi-permanent
camp has been set up. Dirty, rotting pieces of canvas has been tied up between
some tree trunks and boulders, providing an effective but smelly wind shelter.
On the ground, more of the smelly, old pieces of canvas have been tossed out,
and are now being used as mattresses. Branches cut from pine trees serve as
stuffing and pillows. Leftover foodstuffs of unknown kinds and descriptions
have been thrown about, and whoever set this camp up does not appear to care
whether their camp site is tidy or not. The whole, grotty camp is centred
around a crudely set up hearth. On the outskirts, further signs of defilement
are present, as whoever camps here obviously takes pleasure in breaking every
fresh tree-branch and trampling every young sapling.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Clawing and snapping at his chest, the monstrous bear strikes furiously.
Bleeding profusely and unable to flee, Gwathion reaches for his weapon 
and manages to stab the bear in a leg. The bear growls in pain and 
recoils momentarily before charging again, even more frenzied.
Gwathion tries to scramble to his feet but is immediately thrown 
against the wall and blacks out.
The frothing bear drags his limp body towards a cavern to the west.
The bear and its prey disappear into the cave. If anything of Gwathion 
or his equipment still remain, it is surely found in the bear's den.

Room: Stinking Lair  
ID: 105886  
Location: east middle anduin  
Description:  
The underground tunnel ends in a small, stinking cave. Among the dark rocks,
numerous bones and some half-eaten corpses lies an open area which is clearly a
residency of some large beast. A small, worn-looking tunnel leads to the north
on the ground level, and judging by the occasional bats that flit above, there
is another passageway above, twisting upwards through the darkness.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Grabbing the blade from its sheath, he slices the webs in front of him, trying
to free himself, yet the webs prove too strong for the blade and it falls from
Gwathion's grasp.
The vision fades for a moment and returns for you to witness one monstrous
spider dropping a drained husk before giving its full attention to Gwathion's
juicy body.
Feasting done, the dried husk -- all that remains of Gwathion now --, is dumped
on a pile of corpses of all manner of creatures. You see some of his belongings
scatter among the corpses as well. The spiders seem to care little for material
things.

Room: Giant, Webbed Cavern  
ID: 107351  
Location: near Fyrchra  
Description:  
Below the cavern dome enormous spider webs stretch out, covering the walls
and the slightly sloping floor. The webbed ground is very sticky, making it
difficult to walk fast. Webs are spun between the ceiling and floor, creating
a maze of walls and niches and pulling on anything going past. Towards the
south-east the floor slopes up and the webs become thicker, rising up to the
silken throne of the lord of this lair.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

With a hard slap, Gwathion regains consciousness. The dunlending captain asks, 'Forgoli?!', shakes
his head for a second and slowly enunciates 'You elf... You have ring?'.
Gwathion, unable to answer suitably, succumbs to the harsh interrogation of the dunlendings. His
pilfered corpse is dragged out of the cave and dumped in some nearby bushes.
The captain examines a brown leather scroll and curses loudly. He tosses the elf's belongings against
the wall where it ends up half-buried beneath the straw covering the cave's floor.

Room: A Storage Cave  
ID: 101824  
Location: between vale ford and woodendoor  
Description:  
This musty cave seems large and dry enough to keep supplies or even a small
band of travellers protected from the elements. The cave was clearly not formed
naturally; a layer of straws lies spread on the floor, and some of the roots
sticking out of the earth seem to have been chopped off with a shovel or some
other tool. A single gush of water trickles down the surface of a rock in the
back wall, where it harmlessly soaks into the ground.
